## Hi there 👋

I'm Rebekah (Beka), a Senior UX Designer with 6 years of experience, and I'm all about putting users at the center of everything I do. 🌟 I believe that great design starts with understanding people, and that’s where my passion for research comes in. 📊 Whether it's conducting user interviews, analyzing data, or diving into usability tests, I’m always looking for new ways to learn and improve my craft.

As I continue to grow in my career, I’m expanding into UX research to deepen my understanding of both qualitative and quantitative insights. 🔍 My goal is to create designs that are not only beautiful but also meaningful and intuitive for the people who use them. 💡

When I’m not designing or researching, you’ll probably find me tinkering with new ideas for UX projects, reading up on the latest design trends, or collaborating with others to solve complex problems. I’m a big believer in lifelong learning and am always excited about new challenges that help me grow! 🚀

Feel free to reach out if you’re passionate about UX, design, or just want to chat about the latest research findings! 💬
